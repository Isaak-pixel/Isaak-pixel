I am Isaak Dyck and I am a 2nd year student in the Interactive Design and Technology program at Saskpolytech. 

Throughtout the program I have learned how to use many programs and coding lanugages. These include:

- Photoshop
- InDesign
- Illustrator

- And more!

I am hoping to continue to learn and expand my knowledge of all things digital and technological!
